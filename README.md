# nft-collection-pipeline
 This repo will be used to demostrate the full process of generating an NFT collection. The Repo contains code for creating the images based on a set of criteria, uploading to IPFS, and saving the metadata of each item. Additionally, the project will have the code necessary to publish on both the rinkeby and ethereum networks.
